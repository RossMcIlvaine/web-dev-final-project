# CSE 40693 - Modern Web Development Group Project: ND Boxing Portal
Group Members: Ross McIlvaine and Maggie Farrell

## Login instuctions:
* Creating an account will automatically create a non-admin account and will also show no workouts in the workouts page (since workouts are specific to a certain user)
* To test an admin account that has workouts, log in using the following credentials: (username: mfarrell, password: test)
* To test a non-admin account that has workouts in the table, log in using the following credentials: (username: notadmin, password: notadmin)

## Feature 6 User Stories
Ross:
* Create a profile page that allows a user to view and edit their profile information
* Incorporate a notification service to email users of important announcements/events (only admins can do this by completing the form on the profile page)
* Allow users to add workouts and exercises to the database using the add workout form under the table

Maggie:
* Create admin and non-admin access (admins can delete data from the home page and also workouts from the workout table)
* Create a home page that contains important announcements, news, and events for the club
* Dynamically filter workouts in the table by muscle group using the dropdown menu above the table

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
